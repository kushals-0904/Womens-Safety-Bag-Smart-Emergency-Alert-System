# MATLAB Alert Logic Simulation

This MATLAB script simulates the decision-making logic of the Women’s Safety Bag system.

## Purpose
- Simulates panic button activation
- Represents GPS data acquisition
- Models emergency SMS alert flow

## How It Works
- User inputs `1` to simulate an emergency
- System displays alert flow and location output
- Input `0` keeps the system in safe mode

This simulation helps validate the alert logic before hardware implementation.
